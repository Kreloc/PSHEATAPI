<#
    .SYNOPSIS
    Opens a connection to the HEAT service web proxy.
    .DESCRIPTION
    Creates a web service proxy from 'FRSHEATIntegration.asmx?wsdl' under the specified role. Returns $true if the
    connection is successfully established, otherwise throws an error.
    .PARAMETER TenantID
    The tenantId property of your HEAT instance.
    .PARAMETER Role
    The access role for which your service account will be connecting to HEAT. Should typically be an admin level
    role or something with granular defined access.
    .PARAMETER Credential
    If not using a 'cachedCredentials' file of type [pscredential] at $PSScriptRoot\data or a service account, you
    will need to provide your own credentials via Get-Credential. The username is just your network username (i.e.
    'jdoe') and your current network password. Ensure that you are passing an appropriate -Role attached to that
    account.
    .PARAMETER NoSSL
    Use this to connect to a HEAT server using http.
    .EXAMPLE
    PS C:\>Connect-HEATProxy -TenantID 'my.tenant.id' -Role 'Admin II'

    Opens a connection to 'my.tenant.id' as an 'Admin II' with the cached credentials if available, otherwrise
    prompts.
    .EXAMPLE
    PS C:\>Connect-HEATProxy -TenantID 'my.tenant.id' -Role 'Service Desk Analyst' -Credential (Get-Credential)

    Opens a connection to 'my.tenant.id', under the 'Service Desk Analyst' role using the credentials provided from
    the Get-Credential pop-up window.
    .EXAMPLE
    Connect-HEATProxy -TenantID "HDSRV01" -Role 'Admin' -Credential (Get-Credential) -NoSSL

    Opens a connection to HDSRV01, under the Admin role using the credentials provided and going to an http endpoint.
    .NOTES
    Please remember that cached credentials are only available to the user that cached them, from the device that
    they were cached on. Take this into account when setting up scheduled tasks or when testing in your own lab.
