    .SYNOPSIS
    Converts the HEAT response into a PSCustomObject.
    .DESCRIPTION
    HEAT returns [FRSHEATIntegrationFindBOResponse] with an 'obj' property of type [WebServiceBusinessObject] that
    contains FieldValues with Name, Value pairs. This does not cast easily to PSCustomObject, so this function simply
    unwraps the FieldValues and rewraps them into a dictionary which can be passed to -Property when creating a new
    PSCustomObject which is then returned in the pipeline.
    .PARAMETER InputObject
    The [WebServiceBusinessObject] from the response of a HEAT API request. Usually your $response.obj (from a
    single query) or $response.objList (from a multiple query) piped in.
    .PARAMETER AdditionalProperties
    A hashtable containing additional properties to be appended to the resultant [PSCustomObject]. Most useful for
    passing the 'boType' along with an object as this can become ambiguous during queries.
    .EXAMPLE
    PS C:\>ConvertFrom-WebServiceObject -InputObject $response.obj

    Converts the $response.obj.FieldValues of a Get-HEATBusinessObject API request into a PSCustomObject.
    .NOTES
    Is there a better way to do this? I still feel like this is slightly clumsy.
